- Submit pull requests (PRs) to contribute code or documentation

How to Contribute
-----------------

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub and clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:

	.. code-block:: bash

		git checkout -b my-feature-branch

3. **Make your changes** (code, tests, or docs). Please follow the code style guidelines below.
4. **Test your changes** locally. Add or update tests as needed.
5. **Commit and push** your branch to your fork.

Code Style and Best Practices
----------------------------

- Follow PEP8 for Python code style.
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Write docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules.
- Add comments to explain complex logic.
- Write tests for new features and bugfixes (see the `tests/` directory for examples).
- Keep pull requests focused and concise.

Testing
-------

Burbuja uses `pytest` for testing. To run the test suite:

.. code-block:: bash

	pytest

Tests are located in the `Burbuja/tests/` directory. Please add tests for any new features or bugfixes.

Reporting Issues and Requesting Features
